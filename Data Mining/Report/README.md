Here, It has been tried to predict What features lead to higher Airbnb rental prices? To investigate this question, this research focuses on the Airbnb market in Florence, Italy.

The methodology of feature selection computed around 22 features as important features. Those features were cross verified using two different packages from “sklearn” library. However, very few features were found to be positively and wisely correlated with the target variable of “price”. Performance metrics evaluated after basic linear regression gave 35 percent coefficient of determination (R-squared) with mean square errors up to 62, which is not so bad for our kind of dataset. Scatter plot plotted to check the variance also showed the model does not fit 100%; however, this works for the kind of dataset worked with here. 

While concluding, it can summarized that features like ‘accommodates’, ‘bathrooms’, ‘bedrooms’, ‘security deposit’, ‘cleaning fee’, ‘guests included’, ‘365 days availability’, ‘Hotel property’ were found to be contributing in making price prediction.
