Due to bigger size of the dataset we are unable to upload dataset file. Thus, we have shared the link of the drive.
This Folder has 3 implementation files with name as below:

    Data Preprocessing - Preprocessing of dataset to make analysis. Steps like data manipulation, data cleaning, data transformation are ,data imputation are involved.

    Random Forest - To select best and important features out of list of feature from dataset we have applied Feature Importance technique using RandomForestRegressor. Obtained important features are utilized in the modeling.

    Regression - This file of code contains the modeling technique Linear Regression that we have applied to check correlation of extracted features by analysing performance metrics of the model.

## Order to follow to implement code:

Data Preprocessing -> Random Forest -> Regression
