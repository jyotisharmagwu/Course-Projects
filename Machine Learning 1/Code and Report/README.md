## Movie Recommendation Engine
The project aims to build a movie recommendation engine based on content based and item based filtering. The objective works on the fundamental where data is provided by the user either explicitly or implicitly. Content based recommender system learns from the user’s data and recommend best matched content. This content based recommender system works more efficiently with larger datasets for more accurate results. For our project we will be using movie dataset and MovieLens dataset with 100K ratings ranging 1-5 from 943 users on 1682 movies. MovieLens dataset is collected by the GroupLens Research Project at the University of Minnesota. In the dataset, each user has rated at least 20 movies and additional information like simple demographic info for the users like age, gender, occupation, zip are also provided. Content recommender system behaves like user-specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user's interest and disinterest based on product features. Here we will build the movie recommender system, based on keywords search for the movies and a user’s own profile of preference to indicate the type of movie the user likes. We will profile the users interests using information collected through the dataset, and recommend movies based on that profile.
